# Definitions

* ECMAScript Standard - a standard document that describes the way a javascript language should work
* Bits - any kind of two values things, usually described as zeros and ones. A typical computer has more than 30 billion bits
* Values - we separate bits into chunks of information called values to make working with bits easier
* Arithemtic - operations such as addition, multiplication etc. These follow the rules of math ie(PEMDAS)
* Operators - symbols used to perform operations such as * + -
* Special Numbers - Infinity, -Infinity, NaN which means not a number, however it is a value of a number type. NaN is the only value this is also not equal to itself
* Strings - represent text that can be wrapped in " ", ' ', or ` `
* Empty values - null and undefined denote the lack of meaningful value
* Closure - A function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure
* Stack - a data structure that allows you to push values into it and pop them out again in the opposite order so that the thing that was added last is removed first.(LIFO)
* Correlation between variables is usually expressed as a value that ranges from -1 to 1. Zero means the variables are not related. A correlation of one indicates that the two are perfectly related—if you know one, you also know the other. Negative one also means that the variables are perfectly related but that they are opposites—when one is true, the other is false.
* delete operator - unary operator that that when applied to an object property removes it from the object
* in operator - when applied to a string or object, tells you whether that object has that property name (returns a bool)
* Object.keys - returns an array of strings-- the object's property names
* Object.assign - copies all properties from one object into another
* indexOf - returns the index(position)of that value(searches from start to end)
* lastIndexOf - returns the last instance of that value's index (searches from end to start)
* indexOf and lastIndexOf take in an optional argument that indicates where to start searching
* concat - method can be used to glue arrays together to create a new array, similar to what the + operator does for strings
* slice - takes start and end indices and returns an array that has only the elements between them. if index is not given, slice will take all of the elements after the start index. You can also omit the start index to copy the entire array
* padStart -  takes the desired length and padding character as arguments.console.log(String(6).padStart(3, "0"));
// → 006
* split && join
* repeat - method creates new string containing multiple copies of the original string
* Math.max - returns max value
* spread operator - unpacks the collected elements into single elements (can be the first element)
* rest operator - collection of REMAINING elements into a array (needs to be the last element)
* Math.max
* Math.min
* Math.sqrt
* Math.random -  returns a new pseudorandom number between zero (inclusive) and one (exclusive) every time you call it
* Math.floor - gives a whole number by rounding down 
* JSON -  All property names have to be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are allowed
* JSON.parse
* JSON.stringify 
* Methods - functions that live in properties and (usually) act on the value they are a property of.
